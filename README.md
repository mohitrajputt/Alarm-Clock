# Clock Alarm Webpage

This is a simple clock alarm webpage developed using only vanilla JavaScript. It provides several functionalities including displaying real-time clock face, setting alarms, managing alarm containers, and switching between light and dark mode.

## Features

- **Clock Face**: Shows real-time clock at the bottom of the page.
- **Set Alarm**: Clicking on the "Set Alarm" container allows you to set time and date for the alarm. You can then save or cancel the alarm. Once set, the alarm container displays the set time, remaining time, and name of the alarm. When the alarm goes off, a popup alert with a ringtone and message is displayed.
- **Tools**: Add : Add creates a clone of the initial alarm container. It's recommended to create the initial alarm first and then make copies to modify the original.
- Delete: Deletes the alarm container from the right side.
- **Light/Dark Mode** You can switch between light and dark mode by clicking on the UI mode button.
